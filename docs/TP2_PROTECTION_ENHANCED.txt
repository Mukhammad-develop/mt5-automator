================================================
   ✅ TP2 PROTECTION - NOW MOVES SL TO BREAKEVEN!
================================================

WHAT YOUR CLIENT ASKED:
=======================
"After reaching TP2, does SL move to BE for each position?"

ANSWER: YES, NOW IT DOES! (NEW FEATURE)
========================================

WHAT HAPPENS WHEN TP2 IS HIT:
==============================
1. ✅ Cancel all pending orders
2. ✅ Block new orders from being placed
3. ✅ **Move remaining positions' SL to BREAKEVEN** (NEW!)
4. ✅ Let positions run risk-free to TP2


HOW IT WORKS:
=============

EXAMPLE: BUY XAUUSD Signal
--------------------------
Entry 1: 2650.50 (SL: 2645, TP1: 2655) - FILLED
Entry 2: 2649.35 (SL: 2645, TP2: 2660) - FILLED
Entry 3: 2648.20 (SL: 2645, TP2: 2660) - PENDING

Price Action:
1. Price reaches 2655 → Entry 1 closes at TP1 ✅
2. Price continues up to 2660 → TP2 HIT! 🎯

TP2 Protection Activates:
-------------------------
✅ Entry 3 (pending) → CANCELLED (won't fill anymore)
✅ Entry 2 (still open) → SL moved from 2645 to 2649.45 (BE + 0.10)

Result:
-------
🛡️ Position 2 is now RISK-FREE!
💰 Can only make profit, cannot lose!
📊 Runs to TP2 (2660) or breaks even


CONFIGURATION:
==============
In config.env:

TP2_MOVE_TO_BREAKEVEN=true   # Enable (RECOMMENDED)

If you want old behavior (don't move to BE):

TP2_MOVE_TO_BREAKEVEN=false  # Disable


WHAT YOU'LL SEE IN LOGS:
========================
When TP2 is hit:

2025-12-08 11:30:45 [WARNING] Activating TP2 protection for signal abc123
2025-12-08 11:30:45 [INFO] Cancelled 1 pending orders for signal abc123
2025-12-08 11:30:45 [INFO] ✅ Moved position #123456 to BE: SL=2649.45 (TP2 protection)
2025-12-08 11:30:45 [WARNING] 🛡️ Moved 1 position(s) to BREAKEVEN (TP2 protection)
2025-12-08 11:30:45 [WARNING] TP2 PROTECTION ACTIVE for signal abc123


BENEFITS:
=========
✅ Protects profits after TP2
✅ No risk of losing after TP2 hit
✅ Positions can still reach full TP2
✅ Automatic - no manual intervention


SMART LOGIC:
============
- Only moves SL if new BE is BETTER than current SL
- For BUY: BE = entry + $0.10
- For SELL: BE = entry - $0.10
- Small buffer for spread/commission


SCENARIO COMPARISON:
====================

WITHOUT TP2 BE Move (Old):
- TP2 hit at 2660
- Position still has SL at 2645
- Price reverses to 2644
- ❌ Position closes at LOSS (-5 points)

WITH TP2 BE Move (New):
- TP2 hit at 2660
- Position SL moved to 2649.45 (BE)
- Price reverses to 2644
- ✅ Position closes at BE (0 loss)


SUMMARY:
========
✅ NEW: SL automatically moves to BE when TP2 hit
✅ Protects your profits
✅ Enabled by default (TP2_MOVE_TO_BREAKEVEN=true)
✅ Smart logic - only improves SL, never makes it worse
✅ Works for ALL pairs automatically


Tell your client: "Yes! Now when TP2 is reached, 
all remaining positions automatically move to breakeven. 
This protects your profits!"


This is a MAJOR safety feature! 🛡️
